# Real-Time Stream Enhancement

**Real-Time-Stream-Enhancement** is a Python-based system designed to process live audio-video streams for improved quality and efficiency.  
It receives a stream (or video) from a source, processes the **audio** and **video** in real-time, and outputs the enhanced content as a live stream to **YouTube** or other platforms.

## ✨ Features

### 🎥 Video Compression with Motion Estimation

- Detects motion and **identifies important regions** in the video (foreground).
- Compresses static background areas more aggressively to save bandwidth.
- Achieves **content-aware encoding** for better quality at lower bitrates.

### 🎙️ Real-Time Audio Denoising

- Removes background noise while preserving speech clarity.
- Uses signal processing and filtering techniques from **SciPy** and **NumPy**.
- Optimized for live stream latency constraints.

### 🗣️ Speech-to-Text Translation (Optional Extension)

- Converts real-time speech into text.
- Can integrate translation into multiple languages.

## 🚀 Goals

- **Video Content-Aware Encoding** – Keep important motion details sharp while reducing background bitrate.
- **Audio Noise Reduction** – Deliver crystal-clear audio for better viewer experience.
- **Speech-to-Text Translation** – Enable multilingual accessibility.
- **Real-Time Processing** – Maintain low latency for live streaming.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – Motion estimation, foreground/background detection.
- **NumPy / SciPy** – Signal and image processing.
- **FFmpeg** – Stream handling, compression, and encoding.
- **YouTube Live API** – Output streaming.
